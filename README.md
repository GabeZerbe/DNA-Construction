# DNA-Construction

This is an extremely old project I made for my 8th grade science teacher, meant as a digitized version of a card game he would use during the bio-chem sections to teach us about how DNA chains are made.

I'm not going to support it as it was never really meant for public use, and I've since lost the source files between 3 different laptops dying on me.
