# DNA-Construction
Simple program to help facilitate the teaching of how bonds between atoms can create molecules of DNA to middle school grade students.

Requested by and delivered to my 8th grade science teacher who provided design documentation and an example of the card game he originally used to teach this subject.

I will be the first to admit this game is terrible and I originally made it while in highschool, please spare yourself and don't play it.
